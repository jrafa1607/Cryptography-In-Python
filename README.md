### 🛡️ Cryptography Implementations

In this section, you will find implementations and useful links for various ciphers.

| Cipher | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **AES** | Advanced Encryption Standard, A highly secure symmetric block cipher. |
| **Caesar Cipher** | Cipher where each letter is shifted a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. |
| **ElGamal** | Based on the Discrete Logarithm problem. |
| **Feistel Cipher** | Splits block in half, applies round function and reverse subkeys. |
| **Rabin's CryptoSystem** | Cipher based on the Quadratic Square Root problem. |
